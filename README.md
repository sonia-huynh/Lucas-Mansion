### 🐭 Who is Lucas???

Lucas' Mansion was a project my team and I created while at Dev Academy, as our final group project. Our goal was to develop a virtual point and click escape room within a web browser, complete with engaging puzzles and games.

Lucas is the mouse logo for this game and is a beloved running joke throughout our bootcamp, thus, In honor of Lucas, we named our final group project after him.


### 🎯 MVP Goals:
* Create at least four different games to practice game logic
* Create multiple clickable items within the room each with their own pop up component
* Create at least 3 separate routes to different rooms

  
### 🧠 Stretch Goals: (We achieved them all!)
* Incoorporate a different bakcground song for each setting, as well as audio for each different item clicked
* Having conditionals to prevent players from escaping the room before completing all required games
* Deply app: [Play here!](https://lucas-mansion.pushed.nz)
* Incoorporate a timer 
* Include a leaderboard scoring players based on completion time 
* Have different settings for turning off audio in each room
